               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Naga Harshini Voruganti

 
B: 

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	     10       
coding 	  	  	       55-60            
writeup 	  	  	     8         
planning (alone) 	  	 5-6 	       
total (including meetings) 70-80	   	 


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?
    We mostly pair programmed. But I was the driver for the
implementation of Vectorization and my teammate reviewed. And we reversed our
roles for the implementation of MPI.
(b) Did you complete the assignment?
    yes
(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
    We were able to coordinate well for pair programming. Our major
challenge was debugging the code. We had to spend a lot of time to match the
errors with default runs.
(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
    Communication overhead can bottleneck our performance. Also, the
impact we would be having with number of nodes we use on comet is huge.
which the performance almost doubled.
(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
    None
(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
    None
