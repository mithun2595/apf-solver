               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: 

 
B: Mithun Chakaravarrti Dharmaraj

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	        	 10
coding 	  	  	              	    60-65
writeup 	  	  	              8-9
planning (alone) 	  	  	       3-5
total (including meetings)               	 80-90 	 


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?
    We did pair programming. I was typing the code for the implementation of MPI and enabling 2D geometries and was reviewing the implementation for vectorization.
(b) Did you complete the assignment?
    yes
(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
    In my opinion, doing pair programming was really helpful. I found the implementation of 2D geometry a little difficult though as we had to manage all the corner cases.
(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
    Vectorization of the code gives a huge uplift. We saw cases for which the performance almost doubled.
(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
    None
(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
    None
